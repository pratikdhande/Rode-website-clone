It's 18th project given as an assignment in **_Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp  Live Class_**. this project is totally created using tailwind css and this website is Responsive too. i faced difficuties in making some components responsive and mainupulating images is liitle tricky but eventually i solved issues and completed the project, and learned a lot.
